1
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:33,097
You're wondering why I
brought you all here.

2
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,568
After all, we just had a feast.

3
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,537
Since when does old Walder

4
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,507
give us two feasts in a single fortnight?

5
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,979
Well, it's no good being
Lord of the Riverlands

6
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,382
if you can't celebrate with your family.

7
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,883
That's what I say!

8
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,253
Yes!

9
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,465
I've gathered every Frey
who means a damn thing

10
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:08,333
so I can tell you my plans
for this great house

11
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,235
now that winter has come.

12
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:14,472
But first, a toast!

13
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,644
No more of that Dornish horse piss!

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,614
This is the finest Arbor gold!

15
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,617
Proper wine for proper heroes!

16
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,990
Stand together!

17
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,327
Stand together!

18
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,370
Not you.

19
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,406
I'm not wasting good
wine on a damn woman.

20
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,348
Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,784
I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot.

22
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,887
You're my family, the men who helped me

23
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,957
slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.

24
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,485
Yes, yes.

25
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:12,731
Yes, yes... cheer.

26
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,067
Brave men, all of you.

27
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,637
Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe.

28
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:25,443
Cut the throat of a mother of five.

29
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,580
Slaughtered your guests
after inviting them

30
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,448
into your home.

31
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:37,655
But you didn't slaughter
every one of the Starks.

32
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:42,394
No, no, that was your mistake.

33
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,264
You should have ripped them
all out, root and stem.

34
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,172
Leave one wolf alive

35
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,909
and the sheep are never safe.

36
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,837
When people ask you what happened here...

37
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,106
tell them the North remembers.

38
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,446
Tell them winter came for House Frey.

40
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,542
You wildlings?

41
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,579
I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed.

42
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,494
This is Brandon Stark,

43
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:07,284
son of Ned Stark.

44
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,124
How do I know that's true?

45
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,530
You were at the Fist of the First Men.

46
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,065
You were at Hardhome.

47
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,969
You've seen the Army of the Dead.

48
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,206
You've seen the Night King.

49
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,308
He's coming for us.

50
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,611
For all of us.

51
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,254
Okay, come on.

52
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,456
Let's get them inside.

53
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,621
I want every northern maester
to scour their records

54
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,792
for any mention of dragonglass.

55
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,894
Dragonglass kills white walkers.

56
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,562
It's more valuable to us now than gold.

57
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,198
We need to find it, we need to mine it,

58
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,033
we need to make weapons from it.

59
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,271
Everyone aged 10 to 60

60
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,507
will drill daily with spears,
pikes, bow and arrow.

61
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,710
It's about time we taught these
boys of summer how to fight.

62
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:42,013
Not just the boys.

63
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,515
We can't defend the North

64
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,684
if only half the population is fighting.

65
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,388
You expect me to put a spear
in my granddaughter's hand?

66
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:55,059
I don't plan on knitting by the
fire while men fight for me.

67
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,129
I might be small, Lord Glover,
and I might be a girl,

68
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,597
but I am every bit as
much a Northerner as you.

69
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,466
Indeed you are, my lady.
No one has questioned...

70
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,668
And I don't need your
permission to defend the North.

71
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:12,343
We'll begin training every man,
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

72
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,445
Aye!

73
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,913
While we're preparing for attack,

74
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,282
we need to shore up our defenses.

75
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,785
The only thing standing between us and
the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

76
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,689
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

77
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,192
I'm not the king of the Free Folk.

78
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,996
But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

79
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,200
You want us to man the castles for you?

80
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,801
Aye.

81
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,571
Last time we saw the Night
King was at Hardhome.

82
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,908
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

83
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,476
Then that's where I'll go.

84
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,612
Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.

85
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,516
If they breach the Wall,

86
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,051
the first two castles in their path

87
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,587
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

88
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:00,258
The Umbers and the Karstarks
betrayed the North.

89
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,893
Their castles should be torn down

90
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,627
with not a stone left standing.

91
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,230
The castles committed no crimes.

92
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,666
And we need every fortress
we have for the war to come.

93
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,004
We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

94
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,539
loyal families who supported
us against Ramsay.

95
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,742
Aye!

96
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,978
The Umbers and the Karstarks

97
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,514
have fought beside the
Starks for centuries.

98
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,233
They've kept faith for generation
after generation.

99
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:27,786
And then they broke faith.

100
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,754
I'm not going to strip these
families of their ancestral homes

101
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,324
because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

102
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,026
- So...
- So there's no punishment for treason

103
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,594
and no reward for loyalty?

104
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,369
The punishment for treason is death.

105
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,205
Smalljon Umber died on
the field of battle.

106
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,042
Harald Karstark died on
the field of battle.

107
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,444
They died fighting for Ramsay.

108
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,046
Give the castles to the families

109
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,415
of the men who died fighting for you.

110
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,597
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

111
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,335
I executed men who betrayed me.

112
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:21,605
I executed men who refused
to follow orders.

113
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,407
My father always said,

114
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,977
"The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword,"

115
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,280
and I have tried to live by those words.

116
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:32,716
But I will not punish a son
for his father's sins,

117
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,186
and I will not take a family home away

118
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,589
from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

119
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,158
That is my decision,

120
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,861
and my decision is final.

121
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,002
Ned Umber.

122
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,344
Alys Karstark.

123
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,128
For centuries, our families fought

124
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,930
side by side on the battlefield.

125
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:24,935
I ask you to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

126
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,438
to serve as our bannermen

127
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,274
and come to our aid whenever called upon.

128
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,184
Stand.

129
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,590
Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore.

130
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,593
The North needs to band together,

131
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,095
all the living north.

132
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,163
Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys,

133
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:56,900
now and always?

134
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,370
Now and always!

135
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,724
You are my sister, but I am king now.

136
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,359
Will you start wearing a crown?

137
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,961
When you question my decisions

138
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,130
in front of the other lords
and ladies, you undermine me.

139
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,084
So I can't question
your decisions anymore?

140
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:28,967
Of course you can, but...

141
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,202
Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

142
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,304
You think he was a good king?

143
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:36,907
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

144
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,347
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

145
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,948
Thank you.

146
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,586
You're good at this, you know.

147
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,988
- At what?
- At ruling.

148
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:52,823
No.

149
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,824
You are.

150
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,427
You are.

151
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:00,131
They respect you, they really do,

152
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,299
but you have to...

153
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,700
Why are you laughing?

154
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:05,902
What did father used to say?

155
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,240
Everything before the
word "but" is horse shit.

156
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,707
He never said that to me.

157
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,444
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

158
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,514
Because he was trying to protect us.

159
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,517
He never wanted us to see how
dirty the world really is,

160
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,253
but Father couldn't protect
me and neither can you.

161
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,955
- Stop trying.
- All right, I'll stop trying to protect you

162
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,323
and you stop trying to undermine me.

163
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,626
I'm not trying to undermine you!

164
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,063
You have to be smarter than Father.

165
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,732
You need to be smarter than Robb.

166
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,869
I loved them, I miss them, but
they made stupid mistakes,

167
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,937
and they both lost their heads for it.

168
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,140
And how should I be smarter?

169
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,708
By listening to you?

170
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,946
Would that be so terrible?

171
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,983
A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

172
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:04,961
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

173
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,863
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

174
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,499
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms..."

175
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,033
What does she want?

176
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,970
Come to King's Landing.

177
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,774
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

178
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,910
You've been so consumed with
the enemy to the north,

179
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,745
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

180
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,781
I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

181
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,418
And believe me, you'd think of
little else if you had, too.

182
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,119
We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

183
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,954
There's nothing between us and Cersei.

184
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,890
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

185
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,694
Winter is here. The Lannisters
are a southern army.

186
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,161
They've never ranged this far north.

187
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:41,465
You're the military man, but I know her.

188
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,835
If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

189
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,105
Everyone who's ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

190
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,277
You almost sound as if you admire her.

191
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,049
I learned a great deal from her.

192
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,655
What is this?

193
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,324
It's what we've been waiting
for our whole lives.

194
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,126
It's what Father trained us
for, whether he knew it or not.

195
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,628
He knew it.

196
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,266
Made me memorize every damn city,
town, lake, forest, and mountain.

197
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,434
It's ours now. We just have to take it.

198
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,204
You've been quiet since you came home.

199
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,673
Are you angry with me?

200
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,041
No, not angry.

201
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,110
Are you afraid of me?

202
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,280
Should I be?

203
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,887
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
Tyrion to be her Hand.

204
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,691
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

205
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,694
hoping to take back her father's throne.

206
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,095
Our little brother,

207
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,231
the one you love so much,

208
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,066
the one you set free,

209
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,370
the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

210
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,807
now he stands beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

211
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:37,448
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

212
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,249
Where will they land?

213
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,286
Dragonstone.

214
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,056
They have deep-water ports for the ships.

215
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,058
Stannis left the castle unoccupied,

216
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,526
and that's where she was born.

217
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,829
Enemies to the east.

218
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,597
Enemies to the south...

219
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,600
Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.

220
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,435
Enemies to the west...

221
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,237
Olenna, the old cunt.

222
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,474
Another traitor.

223
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,642
Enemies to the north.

224
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,746
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

225
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,749
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

226
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,418
Enemies everywhere. We're
surrounded by traitors.

227
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,119
You're in command of the
Lannister army now.

228
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,256
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

229
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,559
We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

230
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:26,730
The Tyrells have the grain, the
Tyrells have the livestock.

231
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,766
Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside

232
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,068
a Dothraki horde and
Unsullied slave soldiers?

233
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,738
If they think Daenerys will win.

234
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,707
No one wants to fight on the losing side.

235
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,910
Right now, we look like the losing side.

236
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,913
I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

237
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,649
Three kingdoms, at best.

238
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,218
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

239
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,020
I understand we're in a war for survival.

240
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,056
I understand whoever loses dies.

241
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,358
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

242
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,927
that lasts a thousand years.

243
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,530
A dynasty for whom?!

244
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,499
Our children are dead.

245
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,967
We're the last of us.

246
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,102
A dynasty for us, then.

247
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,841
We never talked about Tommen.

248
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,679
There's nothing to say.

249
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,648
Our baby boy killed himself.

250
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,215
He betrayed me.

251
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,717
He betrayed us both.

252
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,486
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead...

253
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,921
mother, father, and all our children?

254
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,490
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

255
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,726
But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

256
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,830
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

257
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,204
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

258
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,407
Where are our allies now?

259
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,610
You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

260
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,278
I heard.

261
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,814
- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

262
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,816
He was a useless, old coward,

263
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,651
but the Freys supported us.

264
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,019
Now they're all dead.

265
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,754
Whoever killed them is no friend of ours.

266
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,289
We need allies.

267
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,091
Stronger, better allies.

268
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,293
We can't win this war alone.

269
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,899
You think I listened to Father for
40 years and learned nothing?

270
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,270
The Greyjoys?

271
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,873
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

272
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,709
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

273
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,277
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

274
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,813
the new King of the Iron Islands.

275
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,516
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

276
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,619
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

277
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,055
How are they different from the Freys?

278
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,657
They both broke their promises

279
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,926
and murdered their former friends
as soon as it suited them.

280
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,929
So does everyone when it suits them.

281
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,565
Unlike the Freys, they have ships.

282
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,200
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

283
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,604
I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

284
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,840
All they know how to do is steal things
they can't build or grow themselves.

285
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,943
Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.

286
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:27,945
Oh, what did he come here for, then?

287
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:29,713
A queen.

288
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,562
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

289
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,931
they turned on me.

290
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,165
Their own uncle.

291
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,802
They stole my best ships and ran.

292
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:53,971
Sailed them right across the world

293
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,272
and gave them to the Dragon Queen

294
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,743
so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

295
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,213
It's nothing compared to
the treason you suffered

296
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,883
at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

297
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,653
But still, it bothers me.

298
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,190
Murdering them would make
me feel a lot better.

299
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:18,394
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

300
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,296
are fighting for the same side,

301
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,833
I thought we rightful monarchs

302
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,535
could murder them together.

303
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,310
You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

304
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,351
The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

305
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:45,421
but as I recall, you
were soundly defeated.

306
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,223
Come to mention it,

307
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,626
weren't you the one who
started that rebellion

308
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:53,797
by sailing to Casterly Rock and
burning the Lannister fleet?

309
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,498
You certainly caught us there.

310
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,334
Very smart move on your part.

311
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:02,572
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

312
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:03,807
I was there.

313
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,642
I remember very well.

314
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,177
I saw you.

315
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,479
I heard so much talk.

316
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,116
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

317
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,818
I didn't believe it, to be honest.

318
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,121
But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

319
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,356
and started cutting people down...

320
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,495
it was glorious.

321
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,897
Like a dance.

322
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,100
The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

323
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,468
The place was getting crowded.

324
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,005
I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.

325
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,207
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

326
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,676
A good thing for me.

327
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,279
If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

328
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,215
If I hadn't done that,

329
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,885
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

330
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,788
If not the most humble.

331
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,091
You're not humble.

332
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,028
You're the queen of a great nation.

333
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,897
You don't care about the Iron Islands.

334
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:05,568
They're nothing but rocks
and bird shit and...

335
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,438
and a lot of very unattractive people.

336
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,074
The Iron Fleet, on the other hand,

337
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,144
that's something else entirely.

338
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,447
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

339
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,052
With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas.

340
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,888
You can defeat the invaders of the east

341
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,824
and the pretenders of
the north and south.

342
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,559
What do you want in return?

343
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,597
Ever since I was a little boy,

344
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,499
I wanted to grow up and marry

345
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,635
the most beautiful woman in the world.

346
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:41,337
So here I am,

347
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,807
with a thousand ships

348
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,441
and two good hands.

349
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,448
I decline your proposal.

350
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:55,919
Why?

351
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:57,620
You're not trustworthy.

352
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,024
You've broken promises to allies before

353
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,493
and murdered them at the
nearest opportunity.

354
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,162
You murdered your own brother.

355
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,731
You should try it. Feels wonderful.

356
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,368
I don't expect you to trust me outright.

357
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,771
You need proof of my honest intentions.

358
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,239
In my experience,

359
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,242
the surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

360
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,511
A priceless gift.

361
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,379
I won't return to King's Landing

362
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,548
until I have that for you.

363
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,237
Ah, Maester Weyland.

364
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:37,840
A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.

365
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,076
Weigh that.

366
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,481
The triumph of transitory pleasures.

367
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,383
Mankind's curse.

368
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:49,486
Archmaester, I was wondering...

369
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,421
What's the weight?

370
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:54,491
147.

371
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,397
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

372
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,500
I don't remember your proposition.

373
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,736
I asked you if, in light of
what I've seen in the North,

374
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,906
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

375
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,607
That area is reserved for maesters.

376
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,144
- Are you a maester?
- No.

377
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,346
Not a very strong proposition, is it?

378
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,224
Archmaester, with respect,

379
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,060
I've seen them...

380
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,328
the Army of the Dead.

381
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,697
The white walkers.

382
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,893
I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

383
00:30:37,894 --> 00:30:39,735
but everyone in the Citadel,

384
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,904
those who will even talk to me,

385
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,740
they all doubt the walkers ever
existed in the first place.

386
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:47,277
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

387
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,445
It's their job.

388
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,253
But the tales of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

389
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,924
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

390
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,527
Sources in the restricted area?

391
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,229
The very same.

392
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,898
And the simplest explanation

393
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,834
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

394
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,336
is that you're telling the truth

395
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,473
and that you saw what you say you saw.

396
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:19,476
So, you believe me.

397
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,212
I do.

398
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,013
You'll finish weighing that heart?

399
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,119
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

400
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,890
We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

401
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,193
And we're not like the
people north of the Twins.

402
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:43,433
In the Citadel, we lead different
lives for different reasons.

403
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,004
We are this world's
memory, Samwell Tarly.

404
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,973
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

405
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,143
Don't remember any meal but the last,

406
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,501
can't see forward to any but the next.

407
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:57,980
And every time you leave the
house and shut the door,

408
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,916
they howl like you're gone forever.

409
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,886
When Robert's Rebellion was raging,

410
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,721
people thought the end was near.

411
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,824
The end of the Targaryen dynasty.
"How will we survive?"

412
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:12,262
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

413
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,197
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush...

414
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,266
"The end is near! How will we survive?"

415
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,135
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

416
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,271
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

417
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,073
But it wasn't. None of it was.

418
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,411
The Wall has stood through it all.

419
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,649
And every winter that
ever came has ended.

420
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,025
Be a good lad. Clean this up.

421
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:34,544
Nope.

422
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:46,656
Nope.

423
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,137
You're a lucky man.

424
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:08,478
I've heard she beat the
Hound in single combat.

425
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,751
She's a very impressive woman.

426
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,254
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

427
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,526
I want you to be happy.

428
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:25,928
I want you to be safe.

429
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,229
I am safe.

430
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:30,400
I'm at home, surrounded by friends.

431
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:33,869
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

432
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,542
What about happy?

433
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,946
Why aren't you happy?

434
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,915
What do you want that you do not have?

435
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,651
At the moment, peace and quiet.

436
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,959
No need to seize the
last word, Lord Baelish.

437
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,395
I'll assume it was something clever.

438
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,132
My lady.

439
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,000
My lady.

440
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,979
Why is he still here?

441
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,716
We need his men.

442
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:23,419
Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton
would still hold this castle.

443
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,422
Littlefinger saved us.

444
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,228
He wants something.

445
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,332
I know exactly what he wants.

446
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,974
¶ He rode through the
streets of the city ¶

447
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,010
¶ Down from his hill on high ¶

448
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,581
¶ O'er the winds and the
steps and the cobbles ¶

449
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:55,084
¶ He rode to a woman's sigh ¶

450
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:58,320
¶ For she was his secret treasure ¶

451
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,724
¶ She was his shame and his bliss ¶

452
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,627
¶ And a chain and a keep are nothing ¶

453
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,296
¶ Compared to a woman's kiss ¶

454
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:10,800
¶ For hands of
gold are always cold ¶

455
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,503
¶ But a woman's hands are warm ¶

456
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:17,339
¶ For hands of gold are always cold ¶

457
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,410
¶ But a woman's hands are... ¶

458
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,045
That's a pretty song.

459
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,113
I've never heard it before.

460
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,581
It's a new one.

461
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,584
Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.

462
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,052
I don't want to steal your food.

463
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,422
You're not stealing, we're offering.

464
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,891
Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.

465
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,787
You heading south?

466
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,856
King's Landing.

467
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,958
Poor girl.

468
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,627
Not so bad, is it?

469
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,763
Depends on your taste, I guess.

470
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:17,066
If you like your streets covered in shit
and pig's blood, it's the town for you.

471
00:37:17,622 --> 00:37:19,902
All my life, I wanted
to see the Red Keep,

472
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,071
the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit.

473
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,006
Then when I finally make it,

474
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,208
they wouldn't let me within
a mile of the Red Keep,

475
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,177
the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell,

476
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,145
and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.

477
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:32,014
The people who live there,

478
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,750
they'd skin you alive if they could
make two coppers off your hide.

479
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,853
Worst place in the world.

480
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,221
What are you doing in the Riverlands?

481
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,824
There's been some trouble with
the Freys up at the Twins,

482
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,227
so we're part of the army that's
been sent to keep the peace.

483
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,033
Here you go. Guests first.

484
00:37:51,554 --> 00:37:53,168
Oh, no, I couldn't. You
don't have enough.

485
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,638
My mother always told me
to be kind to strangers.

486
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,673
Strangers will be kind to you.

487
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,187
You're a long way from home.

488
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,289
I'm sure you've had some
adventures, though.

489
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,092
Yeah, endless adventures.

490
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,795
They'll be singing about
us for a thousand years.

491
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:23,465
The truth is when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

492
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:25,801
But now we've been gone a while,
we can't wait to get home.

493
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:29,772
I just think about my dad out
there on his boat all alone.

494
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:31,725
I ought to be out there with him.

495
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,110
My wife just had our first baby.

496
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,413
- Boy or girl?
- Oh, who knows?

497
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,582
You think soldiers get
ravens with news from home?

498
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,055
- I hope it's a girl.
- Why?

499
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,025
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

500
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,126
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

501
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,698
Are you old enough to drink?

502
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,915
It's blackberry wine.

503
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,316
I made it myself.

504
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,886
It's really good.

505
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,391
So, why is a nice girl on her
own heading to King's Landing?

506
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,968
I'm going to kill the queen.

507
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,224
Bad night to be outdoors.

508
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,060
You've got real powerful
magic to figure that out.

509
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:02,131
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

510
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,300
"It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy.

511
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,270
It's gonna be a cold night."

512
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:12,141
You're a grouchy old bear,
aren't you, Clegane?

513
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,809
You want some rum?

514
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,879
Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.

515
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,048
Why are you always in such a foul mood?

516
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,318
Experience.

517
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,792
This seems like a good
place to spend the night.

518
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,730
These people don't want us here.

519
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,667
Seems deserted to me. No livestock.

520
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,735
No smoke coming from the chimney.

521
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,589
I don't like the look of it.

522
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:03,625
For a big, hard man, you scare easy.

523
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,228
I'll tell you what doesn't scare me...

524
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,230
bald cocksuckers like you.

525
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:11,133
You think you're fooling
anyone with that top knot?

526
00:41:11,782 --> 00:41:13,002
Bald cunt.

527
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,505
Come on.

528
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,440
Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.

529
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,476
They don't.

530
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:26,048
See if there's a larder.

531
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,850
They always leave something behind.

532
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:10,826
How do you think it ended for them?

533
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,562
With death.

534
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:16,498
Girl died in her father's arms.

535
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,468
Both of them covered in blood
and a knife at their feet.

536
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,472
I'd say they were starving.

537
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,407
And rather than let his
little girl suffer,

538
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,376
he ended it for both of them.

539
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,611
Doesn't matter now.

540
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,514
No, doesn't matter now.

541
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,530
I've known you a long time, Dondarrion.

542
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,032
Aye.

543
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:54,136
I think the first time we met
was at that tournament...

544
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,372
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

545
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,475
You're not bad.

546
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:01,844
I don't hate you.

547
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,246
Don't like you, but you're not bad.

548
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,048
Thank you, Clegane.

549
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,382
That warms the heart.

550
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,085
But there's nothing special about you.

551
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:12,187
You're right about that.

552
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:15,457
So why does the Lord of Light
keep bringing you back?

553
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,727
I've met better men than you,

554
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:23,632
and they've been hanged from
crossbeams, or beheaded,

555
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:28,503
or just shat themselves to
death in a field somewhere.

556
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:31,606
None of them came back.

557
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,175
So, why you?

558
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,111
You think I don't ask myself that?

559
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:39,281
Every hour of every day?

560
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,016
Why am I here?

561
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,119
What am I supposed to do?

562
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:45,988
What does the Lord see in me?

563
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,325
And?

564
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,595
I don't know.

565
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,597
I don't understand our Lord.

566
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,466
Your Lord.

567
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,235
I don't know what He wants from me.

568
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:03,705
I only know that He wants me alive.

569
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:08,110
If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he
just tell you what the fuck he wants?

570
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,881
Clegane.

571
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,349
Come over here.

572
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,753
Don't worry. The fire won't bite.

573
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,924
I want to show you something.

574
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,261
It's my fucking luck I end up
with a band of fire worshippers.

575
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,629
Aye.

576
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,999
Almost seems like divine justice.

577
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,534
There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt.

578
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:35,637
If there was, you'd be dead...

579
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,907
and that girl would be alive.

580
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,982
- What do you want?
- Look into the flames.

581
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,118
I don't want to look in the damn flames.

582
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:52,821
You saw me bring him back from
the dead after you cut him down.

583
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,591
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

584
00:44:56,693 --> 00:45:00,062
I keep asking and no
one wants to tell me.

585
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,563
We can't tell you.

586
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,832
Only the fire can tell you.

587
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:17,879
What do you see?

588
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:20,983
Logs burning.

589
00:45:21,698 --> 00:45:23,152
Keep looking.

590
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,025
What do you see?

591
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,137
Ice.

592
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,139
A wall of ice.

593
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,576
The Wall.

594
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:51,513
What else?

595
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:55,817
It's where the Wall meets the sea.

596
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,254
There's a castle there.

597
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,030
There's a mountain.

598
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:11,600
Looks like an arrowhead.

599
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,372
The dead are marching past.

600
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,178
Thousands of them.

601
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,719
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

602
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,356
Do you believe we're here for a reason?

603
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,622
What the hell are you doing, Clegane?

604
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,627
Burying the dead.

605
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,742
You knew these people.

606
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,278
Not really.

607
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:33,542
We ask the Father to judge us with mercy.

608
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,678
We ask the Mother to...

609
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,716
Fuck it, I don't remember the rest.

610
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,126
I'm sorry you're dead.

611
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,995
You deserved better.

612
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,096
Both of you.

613
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,622
Hey.

614
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,229
Mom.

615
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,097
You should really sleep, Sam.

616
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,100
The dead don't.

617
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,446
"Legends of the Long Night."

618
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:49,318
The Targaryens used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons

619
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,986
without even knowing what
the First Men used it for.

620
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:10,372
What is it?

621
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,942
It's a map of Dragonstone.

622
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,211
The Targaryens built their
first stronghold there

623
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,079
when they invaded Westeros.

624
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,451
That's dragonglass?

625
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,185
A mountain of it.

626
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:25,387
Beneath the ground.

627
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,689
Stannis told me, but I didn't think...

628
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:31,326
This is important. Jon needs to know.

629
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,581
Has she come yet?

630
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,216
Who?

631
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,452
The Dragon Queen.

632
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,487
Daenerys Stormborn.

633
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,424
Haven't heard anything.

634
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,265
Shall we begin?

635
00:57:17,266 --> 00:58:33,176
